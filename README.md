# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA Practice Repository**, where I’m actively solving problems, documenting concepts, and preparing for top hiring challenges like **Hiring Challenges**, and **upcoming placements**.

This repository reflects my consistent effort to build a strong foundation in **problem-solving**, **algorithm design**, and **code optimization** — key skills required for technical interviews and real-world software development.

## 📚 Why DSA?

**Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** are fundamental to writing efficient code.  
They form the base for solving real-world problems and are a major component of coding interviews.

Mastering DSA:

- Improves analytical thinking and problem-solving
- Builds coding confidence
- Helps write optimized, readable, and scalable code
